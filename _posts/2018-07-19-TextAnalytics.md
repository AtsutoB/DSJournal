Microsoft has brought text analytics to power BI and made it so simple ! 

Check out this tutorial for connecting up power BI to text analytics service: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/tutorials/tutorial-power-bi-key-phrases

Now the big question is, once you follow this tutorial to get the key phrases and sentiment from your text, how can you use these to generate insights? Surprisingly, cognitive services made the first part of getting data out of the text so straight forward that, the question i posed, I had no idea what I could do with the data. But after a bit of head scratching I came up with a project!
So, this article will cover what I came up with! 

My idea is something that I've toyed about for a while now. I've wanted to be able to get an overall view or opinion on construction related topics based off the institute of civil engineers (ICE) news articles and blogs.
